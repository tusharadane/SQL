-- Stored Procedure
-- A stored procedure is a collection of sql statements that are stored in the database
-- A stored procedure can contain business logic, which is one of the key aspects that distinguishes stored procedure from views
-- A stored procedure can accept parameter and you can set varaible write IF statement, etc with the Stored Procedure
-- A stored procdure is a prepared SQL code that you can save,so the code can reused over and over again
-- So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, ave it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it
-- You can also pass parameter to a stored procedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the paramenter value(s) it is passed

-- Syntax:- 

-- Creates a generic stored procedure template
create procedure sp_name(p_i int)
begin
... code goes here
end;

-- Switches to the 'loadingfile' database
use loadingfile;

-- Displays all tables in the current database
show tables;

-- Creates a stored procedure to show all data from airline_info table
DELIMITER //
-- This procedure selects all records from the airline_info table
create procedure showdata()
BEGIN
	select * from airline_info;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Calls the showdata procedure
call showdata();

-- Creates a stored procedure to show specific data based on airline name and number of stops
DELIMITER //

-- CTE - COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION 

-- CTE is a temporary named result set that you can reference within a SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE or DELETE statement.
-- Syntax:- 
-- with cte_name as (cte query)
-- The with clause can include one or more CTEs separated by commas
-- Enables user to more easily write and maintain complex queries via increased redability and simplification
-- CTEs can be useful tool when you need to generate temporary result sets than can be accessed in a SELECT,UPDATES,DELETE or merge statement
-- A CTE must be followed by a single SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE or DELETE statement that references some or all the CTE columns

-- Calculates the total price for each airline
select airline, sum(price) as total_price from airline_info group by airline;

-- Creates a CTE with total price by airline and selects airlines ending with 'o'
with airline_data_info as (select airline, sum(price) as total_price from airline_info group by airline)
select * from airline_data_info
where airline like '%o';

-- Attempts to select all data from the previously defined CTE (this will cause an error)
select * from airline_data_info;

-- Creates a CTE that selects all data from airline_info and joins it with itself
with airline_data as (select * from airline_info)
select * from airline_info a
join airline_Data b
ON  a.id = b.id;

-- Finds the cheapest flight for each airline
WITH CheapestFlights AS (SELECT airline, flight, MIN(price) AS MinPrice FROM airline_info GROUP BY airline, flight)
SELECT airline, flight, MinPrice FROM CheapestFlights
ORDER BY MinPrice ASC;

-- Finds flights with prices below the average price
WITH AvgPrice AS (SELECT AVG(price) AS AveragePrice FROM airline_info),
BelowAvgPriceFlights AS (SELECT flight, airline, s_c, d_c, price FROM airline_info, AvgPrice WHERE price < AveragePrice)
SELECT flight, airline, s_c, d_c, price FROM BelowAvgPriceFlights

-- Finds the most expensive flight for each class
WITH MostExpensiveFlight AS (SELECT class, flight, MAX(price) AS MaxPrice FROM airline_info GROUP BY class, flight)
SELECT class, flight, MaxPrice FROM MostExpensiveFlight ORDER BY MaxPrice DESC;

-- scalar function
-- Scalar functions in SQL return a single value from an input.
-- They can be used in SELECT, WHERE, or other clauses.
-- Examples include functions like `LEN()`, `UPPER()`, and `ROUND()`.
-- Unlike aggregate functions that operate on multiple rows and return a single result and
-- window functions that provide results over a set of rows, scalar functions return a single value for each row.

-- aggregate function 
-- Aggregate functions in SQL operate on multiple rows and return a single summarized value.
-- Common aggregate functions include `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.
-- They are often used with the `GROUP BY` clause to perform calculations on groups of data.
-- Unlike scalar functions, which return a single value for each row, 
-- aggregate functions return one result per group of rows, and differ from window functions as they do not retain row-wise details.

-- window function
-- Window functions in SQL perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row.
-- They are used to compute values like running totals, rankings, and moving averages without collapsing the result set into a single value per group.
-- Common window functions include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `LAG()`.
-- Unlike aggregate functions, which reduce multiple rows to a single value, 
-- window functions return a value for each row while still considering multiple rows in the computation.

-- Window Function
-- A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.
-- Window functions are used to perform complex calculations that involve multiple rows without having to write subqueries or self-joins.
-- They are essential for advanced data analysis, providing powerful capabilities to compute values that depend on the data context 
-- (like rankings or cumulative sums) efficiently and elegantly.
-- Partitioning: It can partition data into groups and perform calculations within each group.
-- Order: It can order the rows within each partition.
-- Types: Common types include ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and SUM().
-- Syntax: Typically written as function_name() OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column).
-- Use Cases: Useful for calculating running totals, ranks, moving averages, and more.
-- Non-Aggregating: Unlike GROUP BY, it doesnâ€™t reduce the number of rows returned by the query.
-- Example: Calculating the rank of employees based on their salary within each department.

-- Selects all columns and adds a total sum of price for all rows
select *, sum(price) over()
from airline_info;
